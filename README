# Bamboo chainresult location issue

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an issue in Atlassian Bamboo causing the chainresult.summary panels to dissapear whenever an app defines a web-panel with location chainresult.summary.right.

The project was created using `atlas-create-bamboo-plugin` with the only notable changes being:

- Updated Bamboo version to 8.2.0
- Added two web panels to atlassian-plugin.xml
- Added two freemarker templates to the root of the resources directory

The web panels:

```
    <web-panel key="jobresult-summary-right" location="jobresult.summary.right">
        <resource name="view" type="freemarker" location="/jobresult-summary-right.ftl" />
    </web-panel>

    <web-panel key="chainresult-summary-right" location="chainresult.summary.right">
        <resource name="view" type="freemarker" location="/chainresult-summary-right.ftl" />
    </web-panel>
```

Whenever the app is enabled, all the panels in the `chainresult.summary` location (notably the comment box) dissapear. They reapper once the app is disabled.
